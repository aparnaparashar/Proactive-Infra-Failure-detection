# Proactive-Infra-Failure-detection using Isolation Forest

This project implements an **unsupervised anomaly detection model** using the **Isolation Forest algorithm** to identify infrastructure failures from system log metrics such as CPU, memory, and disk usage. The goal is to support **proactive maintenance** by detecting anomalies early and reducing incident response times.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: `predictive_maintenance_dataset.csv` (structured performance log data)
- **Features include**:  
  - CPU usage  
  - Memory usage  
  - Disk I/O metrics  
  - Failure status labels (used for evaluation, not model training)

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Improve failure detection **recall** compared to baseline rules
- ✅ Reduce average **incident response time**
- ✅ Visualize anomaly trends over time for proactive infrastructure decisions
